# React Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my 2 player tic-tac-toe game with some extra features built using React and ES6 and styled with Material-UI and CSS.

Try out the game [here](https://achoung.github.io/react-tic-tac-toe).

Extra features include:

- Restart button that appears when the game is over to restart the game.

- Once a player has won, the winning cells highlight.

- Player X and O are randomly picked to start first in a new game.
